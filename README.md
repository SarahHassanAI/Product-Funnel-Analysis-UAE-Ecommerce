# E-Commerce Funnel Analysis for Middle Eastern Retail

## Executive Summary:
Cart abandonment rates were limiting revenue growth with **33% of customers abandoning purchases** before completion. Using **SQL** and **Tableau**, I identified conversion bottlenecks and developed a strategic action plan. The analysis revealed opportunities to **increase conversion rates by 15%** and **recover AED 832K+ in potential annual revenue**.

### The Business Problem:

E-commerce stakeholders identified concerning cart abandonment rates (**33%**) despite strong initial engagement, with mobile users showing the highest dropout rates. This represents significant revenue leakage in the **competitive Middle Eastern** retail market.

How can we determine **where customers drop off** in the purchase journey AND improve conversion rates?

### Methodology:
Applying my background in customer experience & data analytics, I developed:

1. a **SQL data analysis** for funnel metrics and revenue tracking

2. a **Tableau dashboard** for real-time visibility into conversion performances

3. a **Customer segmentation analysis** to spot pain points & opportunities

##### _For this project scope, a CSV file was used. In a production environment, a direct database connection (Snowflake or BigQuery) would be the scalable best practice!_


### Skills:
SQL: CTEs, Joins, Case, Aggregate functions

Tableau: Funnel visualization, geographic mapping, interactive dashboards & KPIs

Python: pandas, SQLite, data manipulation, analysis automation

### Results & Business Recommendation: 
The analysis revealed that UAE _mobile_ users generate **AED 6.09M in revenue** (61% of regional total) but experience the highest abandonment rates. Desktop users show **8% higher average order values**, indicating untapped premium segment opportunities.

**Here's how to fix it:**

a. **Immediate** Actions (0-3 Months):

- Use automated marketing emails for abandoned carts with personalized product recommendations

- Optimize mobile checkout experience through one-click payment options

- Launch targeted promos for high-value customer segments in UAE and KSA markets

b. **Long-Term** Initiatives (6+ Months):

- Develop predictive customer lifetime value modeling to prioritize retention efforts

- Create VIP customer programs for premium segments spot through spending analysis

- Implement A/B testing framework for continuous conversion rate optimization

I believe these adjustments will target the highest-impact leakage points in the customer journey and create a scalable framework for revenue growth!

### Next Steps
- A/B test mobile checkout optimization
- Measure conversion rate impact monthly
- Develop a customer segmentation strategy (for different market regions)
